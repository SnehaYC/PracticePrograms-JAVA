# Related Questions

- Here you will find series of java questions which are related to differents topics which are in Java.

1. What are the features of Java Programming language?

   - 1. Simple - As compaired to C & C++ language Java is simple syntactically and conceptually.
   - 2. Object Oriented - Java is pure object oriented language everthing in java is considered as a class(object).
   - 3. High level - It is based on middle and low level language.
   - 4. Virtual Machine based - It is virtual machine based because exicution od java program is handled by the JVM.
   - 5. Platform Independent - Java follows one programming strategy called as "Write ones and run anywhere"; it means .class file of a Java program gets exicuted on any operating system.
   - 6. Architechtural newtral - According to WORA strategy Java .class file gets exicuted on any microprocessor or in any other hardware component.
   - 7. Dynamic - Everything in java is considered as dynamic; memory allocation, method binding in java is dynamic in nature.
   - 8. Secure - It is secure due to the byte code verification; unsecured code is not able to exicute. Their are many concept in java which are removed due to the security purpose as friend and pointer.
   - 9. Internationally Accepted - Java supported the concept of UNICODE due to which size of character in java is "2 bytes" which can supported by almost every internationatinal lanuguage.
   - 10. Multithreaded - Java has inbuild support for multithreading which enhance the power of java.
   - 11. Network Based - Java contains all the libraries which are for network programming.

2. What is mean by Platform Independent and Architecture neutral?

   - Platform Independent - Java follows one programming strategy called as "Write ones and run anywhere"; it means .class file of a Java program gets exicuted on any operating system.
   - Architechtural newtral - According to WORA strategy Java .class file gets exicuted on any microprocessor or in any other hardware component.

3. Explain JVM architecture.
   -
4. Explain Toolchain of JAVA.
5. What is mean by JDK , JRE and JVM ?
   - JDK (Java Developement Kit)
     - It is a software development kit to develope application in java.
     - It is primarily used for code exicution and has prime functionality of development.
     - JDK is platform dependent i.e. for different platform different JDK required.
     - As JDK is responcible for prime development so it contains tools for devloping, debugging and monitoring java application.
     - JDK = JRE + Development tool.
   - JRE (Java Runtime Envirment)
     - It is the implementaion of JVM and it defined as a software package that provides java class libraries along with JVM and other components to run application written in java programming.
     - JRE is majorly responsible for creating enviornment for code execution.
     - JRE is also platform independent.
     - JRE does not contains tools such as compiler or debugger rather it contains class libraries and other supporting files that JVM requires to run the program.
     - JRE = JVM + Libraries to run the application.
   - JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
     - A Java virtual machine (JVM) is a virtual machine that enables a computer to run Java programs as well as programs written in other languages that are also compiled to Java bytecode. The JVM is detailed by a specification that formally describes what is required in a JVM implementation.
     - It is an abstract machine that is platform dependent and has therr notions as a specification a document that describes requirment of JVM implementaion, a computer program that meets JVM implementaion are responcible to provide a runtime environment for exicuting java byte code.
     - All the implementaion are responsible to provide these implementaion to JRE.
     - It is platform independent.
     - Doesn't include software development tools.
     - JVM = Only runtime enviornment for exicuting the java byte code.
